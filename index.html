                    An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is defined as “...a computing system made up of a number of simple, highly interconnected 
                    processing elements, which process information by their dynamic state response to external inputs.” <i>(Caudill, 1989)<sup><a href=#references>[1]</a></sup></i>. 
                    They are modelled on the biological neural pathways which make up the mammalian brain <i>(Gerven & Bohte 2017)<sup><a href=#references>[2]</a></sup></i>. 
                    They learn by example, just like humans, without having task specific instructions inputted to them <i>(Deep AI, Inc., 2017)<sup><a href=#references>[3]</a></sup></i>. 
                    As an example, in image recognition a neural network may learn by being fed images that are defined as being “car” and “no car” 
                    and learn to identify if other images contain cars. They vary in the way they emulate the brain from emulating a single neurone to 
                    the complex multi neurone structure of the brain which gives it such plasticity <i>(Forrest, 2015)<sup><a href=#references>[4]</a></sup></i>. ANNs can extract meaning from 
                    data that is imprecise and complicated and notice trends and patterns which are too complex for humans or conventional computers to 
                    recognise and can learn and model non-linear relationships between input data and output data <i>(Stergiou & Siganos, 2013)<sup><a href=#references>[5]</a></sup></i>. 
                    This makes it extremely important for computer science as it improves the problem-solving capability of computer systems and 
                    enables solutions to complex problems to be relatively easily obtained when compared with traditional methods of computing.
                </p>

                    In the late 1940s, D.O Hebb created a learning algorithm that became known as Hebbian Learning. This is unsupervised learning, 
                    which later evolved into neural networks. <i>(Hebb, 1949)<sup><a href=#references>[6]</a></sup></i> The first functional multi layered networks were published by Ivakhnenko 
                    and Lapa in 1965 <i>(Ivakhnenko 1973)<sup><a href=#references>[7]</a></sup></i>. Research into neural networks slowed after machine learning research by Minsky and Papert in 
                    1969 discovered two issues with the computers that processed ANNs at the time. The first being the computers inability to process the 
                    exclusive-or circuit and the second, the lack of processing power, which meant the computers couldn’t effectively process large ANNs 
                    <i>(Minsky & Papert, 1969)<sup><a href=#references>[8]</a></sup></i>. Research didn’t pick up pace again until computers had reached far greater levels of processing power.
                    A key trigger for the renewed interest in ANN research was Werbos’s backpropagation algorithm which solved the exclusive-or problem 
                    <i>(Werbos, 1975)<sup><a href=#references>[9]</a></sup></i>. Today, with the advancements in computer processing power using graphics processing units and distributed computing, 
                    companies such as Google and Microsoft have deployed neural networks to use for image and visual recognition problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The importance of neural networks has been emphasised recently by the release of recent GPUs that have an emphasis on compute task rather 
                    than strictly graphical operations. The recent Nvidia GeForce Titan V was released as a “Supercomputing” AI card with specific deep learning 
                    processing cores <i>(Nvidia 2017)<sup><a href=#references>[10]</a></sup></i>. The fact that leading graphics card manufacturers are releasing cards specifically for use in artificial 
                    intelligence applications rather than their traditional approach of focusing on gaming, shows that the major hardware players are realising, 
                    and hoping to cash in on, the importance of AI in the computer science space. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Neural networks have found many applications in many fields, due to their ability to take non-linear data and produce observations which are 
                    more precise than humans themselves can produce, creating more jobs for computer scientists and researchers to develop and implement these systems. 
                    These areas vary from the diagnosis of cancers, telling dangerous cancer cells apart from regular body cells just from the shape 
                    <i>(Alizadeh & Lyons, 2016)<sup><a href="#references">[11]</a></sup></i>, and the increase of speed and reliability of infrastructure affected by natural disasters <i>(Nabian, Meidani, 2017)</i> 
                    to enabling computers to recognise the human voice, with projects such as deep wave from Google, and being able to beat world class players at 
                    games such as the Chinese game Go.
